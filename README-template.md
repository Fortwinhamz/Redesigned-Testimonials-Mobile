## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS BEM


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of : The BEM, em, and Px</h1>
```
```css
.card{
  color: hsl(210, 46%, 95%);
}
```


### Continued development


### Useful resources

- [W3 Media Query](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp) - This helped when i needed to design mobile and i was confused on what breakpoint to use. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.


- [Scallable CSS](https://scalablecss.com/bem-quickstart-guide/#1391467) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the BEM . I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
